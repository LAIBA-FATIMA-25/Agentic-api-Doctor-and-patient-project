This project has been an incredible learning experience, filled with ups and downs. Throughout the development, I faced numerous challenges and errors that often made me feel like giving up. But each setback was an opportunity to learn and improve. It taught me the importance of persistence and problem-solving. There were times when I felt overwhelmed, but overcoming those obstacles made the final result even more rewarding. This project not only helped me grow my technical skills but also strengthened my resilience and determination to keep pushing forward, no matter how tough it gets.
